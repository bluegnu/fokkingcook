The FokkingCook
===============

The "FokkingCook" is an ode to the long and successful carreer of
Dr. Maarten Fokkinga, and his love for elegant algorithms and
functional programming. Thanks to Jan Kuper for coming up with
this idea. Fokkingcook generates a recipe for salmon pasta 
using the principle of algorithmic cooking, i.e., recipes are
really algorithms for cooking.
