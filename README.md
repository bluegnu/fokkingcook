The FokkingCook
===============

The "FokkingCook" is an ode to the long and successful carreer of
Dr. Maarten Fokkinga, and his love for elegant algorithms and
functional programming. Fokkingcook demonstrates the principle of 
algorithmic cooking, i.e., recipes are really algorithms for 
cooking. Everything appropriately formalised in Haskell.
